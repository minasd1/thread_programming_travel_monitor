# thread_programming_travel_monitor
This application provides the same functionality as the travel_monitor application. Only now, it uses thread programming and interprocess communication with sockets. Also in order for thread implementetion to work properly, a cyclic buffer and a pthread_mutex are used.

Further explanation of application functionality and implementation examples will soon be given
